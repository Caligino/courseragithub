üì£ Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in discussions.

üêû Issues
Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

üõ†Ô∏è Pull requests
A pull request is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. üåç

We cannot accept contributions to the REST API reference documentation. If you spot an inaccuracy in the REST API reference documentation, open an issue in the github/rest-api-description repository.

‚ùì Support
We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing product. Unfortunately, we just can't help with support questions in this repository. If you are experiencing a problem with GitHub, unrelated to our documentation, please contact GitHub Support directly. Any issues, discussions, or pull requests opened here requesting support will be given information about how to contact GitHub Support, then closed and locked.
